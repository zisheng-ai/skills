# AdSense Site Builder

AdSense Site Builder is a single-entry skill for planning, building, auditing, and launching useful niche websites for AdSense readiness.

It is designed for builders who want to create small website assets with real search demand and real user value, instead of thin AI article sites or risky traffic schemes.

## What It Builds

This skill can help build several types of AdSense-oriented niche sites:

| Site Type | Best For | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tool site | calculators, generators, converters, checkers | salary calculator, JSON formatter, prompt generator |
| Template library | copyable or downloadable reusable assets | resume templates, email templates, Notion templates |
| Directory site | curated lists with filters and comparison fields | AI tools directory, SaaS alternatives, resource lists |
| Comparison hub | decision support and product/method comparisons | X vs Y, best alternatives, best tools for a use case |
| Checklist hub | procedural topics with steps and timelines | visa checklist, moving checklist, startup launch checklist |
| Tutorial hub | step-by-step problem solving | coding errors, Excel formulas, software workflows |
| Hybrid site | niches with multiple search intents | one primary tool plus guides, templates, and comparisons |

## How It Works

The skill runs a staged site-building pipeline:

1. Validate niches with search demand and AdSense-safe potential.
2. Plan keyword clusters and site structure.
3. Design page models without thin programmatic SEO.
4. Build the useful site experience.
5. Add trust pages such as About, Contact, Privacy Policy, and Terms.
6. Audit technical SEO and AdSense readiness.
7. Create a safe launch plan for real user traffic.

The main workflow lives in `SKILL.md`. The staged submodules live in `references/`.
