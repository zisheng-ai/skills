# Story Long Write

Load this reference when the user asks to write, continue, or revise long-form novel chapters.

## Core Principles

1. **Emotion-first**: Every chapter has one primary emotional goal. Name it before writing a word.
2. **Validated patterns**: If a reference book exists in `reference/`, extract its technique before inventing new structure.
3. **Modular assembly**: Each chapter = hook + escalation + turn + hook-out. Each beat has a proven formula.
4. **Load only what's needed**: Before writing, read only the files relevant to this chapter's conflict and characters. Never load the full book.

## What to Read Before Each Chapter

```
Required:
  tracking/context.md                   — previous chapter ending + open threads
  outline/outline.md                    — this chapter's role in the arc (find by chapter number)

Load only if needed:
  world/characters/{character-name}.md  — only characters appearing in this chapter
  tracking/threads.md                   — only if this chapter resolves or plants a foreshadow
  reference/{book-title}/techniques.md  — only if a reference technique is needed
```

## Parallel Writing (default for new books)

Use this flow whenever writing ≥ 2 chapters from scratch. Single-chapter incremental additions use the sequential process below.

### Step 1 — Expand outline beats

Before spawning any agents, expand `outline/outline.md` so every chapter has a concrete beat entry:

```
Ch-NNN: [primary emotion] | hook: {1-sentence} | turn: {what changes} | hook-out: {open question}
```

All chapters must have this before any parallel writing starts. The beat entries replace `tracking/context.md` as the coordination signal during parallel writing.

### Step 2 — Spawn one Agent per chapter (model: haiku)

Spawn all chapter agents concurrently. To avoid redundant file reads, read shared context once in the main context and pass it into each agent's prompt:

- **Read once, share with every agent:**
  - `world/worldbuilding.md`
  - Full expanded `outline/outline.md` (with beat entries for all chapters)
- **Read once, shard per agent:**
  - `world/characters/{character-name}.md` — only for characters appearing in that chapter
- **Coordination signal:** each agent receives the previous chapter's hook-out line from the outline beat.

Each agent writes to `content/{book-title}/chapters/ch-NNN-{title}.md` and returns its own hook-out line.

Use a **single batch Agent call** when the environment supports it (e.g. one Agent invocation carrying the whole chapter list), otherwise spawn individual Agents per chapter. Either way, all chapters must be produced in parallel, not sequentially.

### Step 3 — Lightweight continuity pass

After all chapter agents complete, do a single sequential pass:
1. Read chapters in order; verify hook-out of chapter N matches the opening of chapter N+1.
2. Fix only continuity breaks — do not rewrite prose for style.
3. Write `tracking/context.md` from the final chapter's ending.
4. Update `tracking/threads.md`, `tracking/timeline.md`, `tracking/character-status.md`.

Keep this pass minimal. Do not run a full quality rewrite here; that is Phase 4.

### Multiple books in parallel

Spawn one top-level Agent per book. Pass only that book's `world/`, `outline/`, and character files so each agent starts with a minimal context. Books share no state and can complete in any order.

## Single Chapter Writing Process

Use this for adding one chapter to an existing book (incremental update only).

1. Read `tracking/context.md` — know the exact last beat.
2. Read the chapter's outline entry in `outline/outline.md`.
3. Name the chapter's **primary emotion** (tension / release / shock / ache / warmth).
4. Name the chapter's **turn**: what changes from start to end?
5. Write the **hook** (≤3 sentences): drop into motion, not setup.
6. Write the **escalation**: raise stakes through action/dialogue. No passive reflection blocks.
7. Write the **turn**: the moment that changes something — reveal, decision, or loss.
8. Write the **hook-out**: end mid-motion or on an open question. Never summarize.
9. Save to `content/{book-title}/chapters/ch-NNN-{title}.md` from the project root, with correct zero-padded number.
10. Update `tracking/context.md`: last beat + open threads + any foreshadow planted.
11. Update `tracking/threads.md` if foreshadow added or resolved.
12. Update `tracking/character-status.md` for any character changes.

## Chapter File Format

```md
---
title: "第一章：夜渡"
chapter: 1
---

Prose starts here — no leading blank line.
```

Frontmatter is optional but recommended. The site loader falls back to filename if `title` is absent.

Prose formatting rules:
- Adjacent paragraphs: single `\n` between them (no blank lines / `\n\n`)
- Dialogue quotes: half-width double quotes `""`
- No `……` or `——` in the prose product — rewrite as action, short sentence, or line break
- No chapter summaries or author notes inline

## Pacing Guidelines

| Chapter type | Word count target | Dialogue ratio | Action beats |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Opening chapter | 3,000–4,500 | 20–30% | 3+ |
| Escalation chapter | 2,500–4,000 | 30–50% | 2–4 |
| Climax chapter | 2,000–3,500 | 15–25% | 4–6 |
| Resolution chapter | 1,500–3,000 | 20–40% | 1–2 |

## Context Handoff (`tracking/context.md` template)

```md
## Last Chapter Ending
{Final action or dialogue — 1–3 sentences}

## Next Chapter Start
{Which action or scene to continue from}

## Open Threads
- {foreshadow/suspense 1}
- {foreshadow/suspense 2}

## Target Emotion for Next Chapter
{tension / release / shock / lingering regret / warmth}
```

Always overwrite `context.md` after each chapter. Do not append history — the file is a rolling handoff.

## Quality Check Before Saving

- Hook: does it drop into motion? No weather, backstory, or setup.
- Turn: does something change? A chapter where nothing changes is a filler chapter.
- Hook-out: does it create forward pull? Reader must want the next chapter.
- No consecutive paragraphs with identical rhythm or length.
- No three consecutive sentences starting with the same subject.
- Run `/story-deslop` before marking a chapter complete if AI flavor is detected.
