# Design System Planning

Use this reference before building any new UI or major redesign. Do the design plan first — do not skip to code.

---

## Step 0 — Design Read (Read the Room First)

Before any palette, font, or layout decision, state a one-line design read:

**"Reading this as: \<genre> fiction for \<audience>, with a \<vibe> language, leaning toward \<aesthetic family>."**

Examples:
- *"Reading this as: serialized web novel for mobile readers, with a clean modern language, leaning toward strong cover grid + restrained reader chrome."*
- *"Reading this as: literary short story collection for desktop readers, with a quiet editorial language, leaning toward typographic hierarchy + minimal UI chrome."*
- *"Reading this as: fantasy serial for CJK readers, with an atmospheric language, leaning toward warm amber palette + system CJK stack."*

If the brief is ambiguous, ask **one** clarifying question. If you can infer from genre, content language, or audience, declare the design read and proceed.

**Anti-default discipline:** Do not default to cream + terracotta + giant serif. Do not default to near-black + neon accent. Do not default to Inter everywhere. These are the LLM defaults for reading apps. Reach past them based on the design read.

---

## Step 1 — Fiction Dials

After the design read, set three dials. Every layout, motion, and density decision is gated by these.

| Dial | Range | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DESIGN_VARIANCE` | 1–10 | 1 = perfectly symmetrical, 10 = artsy chaos |
| `MOTION_INTENSITY` | 1–10 | 1 = static, 10 = cinematic physics |
| `VISUAL_DENSITY` | 1–10 | 1 = art gallery / airy, 10 = cockpit / packed |

**Fiction presets by page type:**

| Page | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reader page | 3–4 | 1–2 | 2–3 | Reading comfort overrides everything. No animation in the prose column. |
| Home / discovery | 6–7 | 3–4 | 3–4 | Enough visual energy to sell the genre; restrained enough to feel like a reading product. |
| Book detail | 5–6 | 2–3 | 3–4 | Genre atmosphere in cover and description; calm catalog. |

**Genre dial adjustments:**

| Genre | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Literary / short story | 4–5 | 1–2 | 2–3 |
| Serialized web novel | 6–7 | 3–4 | 3–5 |
| Light novel / manga | 6–8 | 3–5 | 3–4 |
| Romance | 5–6 | 2–3 | 2–3 |
| Fantasy / historical | 5–6 | 2–3 | 2–3 |
| Thriller / mystery | 5–7 | 2–4 | 3–4 |

**Hard override:** The reader page MOTION dial is always capped at 2. No scroll animations, no entrance transitions, no infinite loops on the prose surface. Discovery pages may use motion; the reader page does not.

---

## Step 2 — Design Plan

Before writing any markup, decide the following and record them as `outputs/<site-slug>/design-brief.md`:

1. **Purpose** — What reading job does this site solve? (Serialized fiction discovery, CJK light novel reading, English short story collection, Spanish romance serial, etc.)
2. **Audience** — Casual web novel reader, serialized fiction subscriber, literary reader, language-learner, manga/manhwa crossover reader, etc.
3. **Tone** — Choose exactly one:
   - Refined editorial (calm, typographic, restrained)
   - Quiet literary (warm paper, minimal chrome)
   - Premium serialized fiction (strong cover grid, genre-forward)
   - Modern manga / light-novel adjacent (structured, character-art-friendly)
   - Warm personal library (bookshelf feel, cozy)
4. **Palette** — Define a theme for DaisyUI using 4–6 named token roles:
   - `base-100`: page background
   - `base-content`: body text
   - `muted`: secondary text and borders
   - `accent`: single genre-aware highlight
   - (optional) `base-200` / `base-300`: subtle surface variation for cards, navigation
5. **Type system** — Define three roles:
   - Display: for site title, book titles, chapter headings
   - Reader body: for prose — must be a highly readable serif or CJK system stack
   - UI/utility: for navigation, controls, metadata — system sans-serif
6. **Layout concept** — How do discovery, book detail, and reader layouts differ between H5 and desktop?
7. **Signature element** — One memorable detail connected to reading, books, chapters, or genre (see below).

**Two-pass process:** First, brainstorm the design plan in thinking. Then review it against the design read — if any part reads like the generic default you would produce for any similar genre, revise that part and say what changed. Only after confirming the relative uniqueness of the plan should you write code.

---

## Signature Element Rules

Spend all the distinctiveness in one place. A good signature element improves reader orientation, mood, or recognition — not decoration. Take one real aesthetic risk you can justify.

Examples that work:
- **Atmospheric detail hero** (web novel / romance / thriller): blurred, darkened, saturated cover fills the hero zone behind the crisp floating cover. See `ui-components.md` Book Detail Hero for implementation. This is the minimum quality bar for web novel builds.
- A chapter progress rail styled as a bookmark ribbon or page-edge marker.
- Book cover cards with a genre badge overlaid on the cover image (dark pill, top-right).
- A reader settings panel that slides in as a "reading lamp" side drawer.
- A "continue reading" card with a short chapter excerpt and a chapter-number marker.
- Desktop reader with a restrained antiquarian left margin rule (visual only, no interaction needed).
- Genre-specific cover accent systems (warm amber for romance, slate for thriller, moss for literary fiction).

Examples that fail:
- A decorative particle animation anywhere on the reader page.
- A split-panel hero with a large illustration above the book catalog.
- A typewriter animation on chapter titles.
- A floating "AI" badge or creation-process callout anywhere.
- Multiple signature elements. One is the rule.

If the signature element does not improve orientation or reading mood, remove it. Chanel's rule applies: before shipping, remove one decorative element you added.

## Genre-Specific Visual Direction

| Genre | Tone | Palette cue | Typography cue | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Literary fiction | Quiet editorial | Warm paper, slate ink | Old-style serif display, comfortable body serif | Flashy gradients, web-novel genre tropes |
| Serialized web novel | Modern, energetic | Strong cover grid, one saturated accent | Clean sans display, readable body serif | Literary pretension, tiny cover cards |
| Light novel / manga | Character-forward | White or light base, single accent | Bold gothic display, system CJK body | Heavy drop shadows, overly dark backgrounds |
| Romance | Warm, personal | Dusty rose, warm sand, or mauve accent | Rounded serif or italic display face | Cool/corporate palettes |
| Fantasy / historical | Atmospheric | Warm amber, parchment, or deep navy | Humanist serif display, generous line height | Neon or high-saturation accents |
| Thriller / mystery | Taut, focused | Near-black base, single cold accent | High-contrast sans display, tight body | Warm/cozy palettes |
| Short story collection | Calm editorial | High contrast, minimal or no accent | Strong typographic hierarchy, no cover grid needed | Cover-grid layouts when there are no covers |

---

## Palette Guidance

Default to calm. The reader page inherits these tokens.

- `--base`: warm off-white (`#f9f6f1`), soft paper (`#faf8f4`), or light neutral (`#f8f8f6`). Never `#ffffff`.
- `--ink`: near-black (`#1a1814`), warm dark (`#1c1916`), or deep slate. Never `#000000`.
- `--muted`: warm gray for metadata, borders, placeholders. WCAG AA compliant against `--base`.
- `--accent`: one restrained color that fits the genre. Used 1–2 times per page. Never used as a background.
- `--night-base`: deep warm neutral (`#141210`) or cool dark (`#121416`). Never `#000000`.
- `--night-ink`: soft off-white (`#e8e4de`) or warm light. Never `#ffffff`.
- Sepia: `--sepia-base: #f2ead8`, `--sepia-ink: #3d3220`.

**Color Consistency Lock:** Once an accent color is chosen, it is used on the whole site. A warm-toned reader site does not suddenly get a blue chapter-nav CTA. Pick one accent, lock it, audit every component before shipping.

**Page Theme Lock:** The site has one theme (light, dark, or system). Sections do not flip between modes. The only exception is the reader page offering light / dark themes as a user preference, controlled by DaisyUI `data-theme` — not section-level overrides. Add sepia only when explicitly requested.

Avoid:
- Cream + terracotta + giant serif as a default for every brief — this is the LLM default for reading apps.
- Neon + near-black as a default "dark reading" treatment.
- Multiple accent colors. One accent per palette, used sparingly.
- Any pure `#000` / `#fff` in any theme.
- AI-purple gradients, glowing orbs, or frosted glass panels on the reader surface.

## Typography Guidance

Reader body typography matters more than display typography. Get body right before touching anything else.

**Display type:** Characterful but not decorative. Use for the site logo, book titles, and section headers only. Prefer `Lora`, `Playfair Display`, `Libre Baskerville`, `Source Serif 4`, or a humanist sans like `Outfit` or `Cabinet Grotesk` for a modern web-novel feel. Avoid `Fraunces` and `Instrument Serif` — they are LLM default display serifs, deployed without thought.

**Reader body:** Highly readable. Prefer `Lora`, `Merriweather`, `Source Serif 4`, or `Georgia` for Latin scripts. For CJK, always use system stacks (see `internationalization.md`). The body face must hold up at 17px mobile with 1.75 line height for 500+ words at a time.

**UI/utility text:** `system-ui` stack for all controls, labels, and navigation. Never use display or body fonts for controls.

**Font choice discipline:**
- `Inter` is discouraged as the default UI font. Pick `Geist`, `Outfit`, or `system-ui` first.
- Never use decorative, handwritten, or novelty display fonts for chapter prose.
- Never apply letter-spacing to body or CJK text. Use it only on uppercase UI labels, sparingly.
- Serif is appropriate for literary/romance/fantasy reader bodies. For thriller, modern web-novel, or manga, a highly readable sans body may be more on-genre.
- If italic is used in display type with descenders (`y g j p q`), use `leading-[1.1]` minimum and add `pb-1` reserve on the wrapper.

**Typography carries personality.** The type treatment should be a memorable part of the design identity — not a neutral delivery vehicle for the content.

---

## Site Logo and Favicon

Never use placeholder text, generic emoji, or external icon libraries. Always generate real assets for launch.

### Entry check

**MANDATORY — run this bash command first. Do not skip it. Do not assume the result.**

```bash
[ -n "$APIYI_API_KEY" ] && echo "API_PATH=apiyi" || echo "API_PATH=claude_svg"
```

**If the output is `API_PATH=apiyi` → you MUST use the apiyi curl path below. Generating SVG when the key is present is wrong.**

If the output is `API_PATH=claude_svg` → print the warning below, then fall back to Claude SVG:
```
\033[33m⚠ WARNING: APIYI_API_KEY is not set. Falling back to SVG logo/favicon generation.\033[0m
\033[33m  To enable AI-generated assets via gpt-image-2-vip, get an API key at:\033[0m
\033[33m  https://api.apiyi.com/register/?aff_code=ijv5\033[0m
\033[33m  Then set: export APIYI_API_KEY="your-key"\033[0m
```

### apiyi path (APIYI_API_KEY is set)

Generate logo and favicon via `gpt-image-2-vip`. Both are square motif images — use `1024x1024`.

```bash
mkdir -p public

# Logo prompt: single symbolic motif for the site genre, transparent or dark background,
# no text, suitable for nav bar. Square composition, clean edges.
# Claude constructs this based on site genre and visual register before running curl
LOGO_PROMPT="{genre-appropriate motif — e.g. glowing sword on dark background for xianxia}"

LOGO_URL=$(curl -s https://api.apiyi.com/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIYI_API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"model\":\"gpt-image-2-vip\",\"prompt\":$(echo "$LOGO_PROMPT" | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.dumps(sys.stdin.read().strip()))'),\"n\":1,\"size\":\"1024x1024\"}" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['data'][0]['url'])")
curl -s "$LOGO_URL" -o public/logo_raw.png
echo "logo saved"

# Favicon prompt: same motif, ultra-simplified, readable at 32px
# Claude constructs this as a simplified version of the logo prompt
FAVICON_PROMPT="{same motif, minimal, high contrast, no text, works at tiny size}"

FAVICON_URL=$(curl -s https://api.apiyi.com/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIYI_API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"model\":\"gpt-image-2-vip\",\"prompt\":$(echo "$FAVICON_PROMPT" | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.dumps(sys.stdin.read().strip()))'),\"n\":1,\"size\":\"1024x1024\"}" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['data'][0]['url'])")
curl -s "$FAVICON_URL" -o public/favicon_raw.png
echo "favicon saved"

# Resize
ffmpeg -i public/logo_raw.png -vf scale=256:256 public/logo.png -y \
  || sips -z 256 256 public/logo_raw.png --out public/logo.png
ffmpeg -i public/favicon_raw.png -vf scale=32:32 public/favicon-32x32.png -y \
  || sips -z 32 32 public/favicon_raw.png --out public/favicon-32x32.png
ffmpeg -i public/favicon_raw.png -vf scale=180:180 public/apple-touch-icon.png -y \
  || sips -z 180 180 public/favicon_raw.png --out public/apple-touch-icon.png
rm public/logo_raw.png public/favicon_raw.png
```

Wire up in `src/app/layout.tsx`:
```ts
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  icons: {
    icon: '/favicon-32x32.png',
    apple: '/apple-touch-icon.png',
  },
}
```

### Claude SVG fallback (APIYI_API_KEY not set — confirmed by entry check)

**Only enter this section if the entry check above returned `API_PATH=claude_svg`. If APIYI_API_KEY is set, go back and use the apiyi curl path.**

Claude writes SVG files directly. Both must reflect the site's visual register and genre (see `cover-styles.md`).

- **`public/logo.svg`** — single motif, works at nav-bar size and 32px. No text in the SVG itself.
- **`public/favicon.svg`** — same motif, simplified for small sizes.

Wire up in `src/app/layout.tsx`:
```ts
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  icons: { icon: '/favicon.svg' },
}
```

SVG favicons are supported by all modern browsers. Acceptable as a launch asset when the API is unavailable.

**Never ship a site with the default Next.js favicon or a missing logo.** Development previews may use placeholders; launch requires real assets.

## Typography Scale

```css
:root {
  /* size */
  --text-xs:   12px;   /* word count, metadata */
  --text-sm:   14px;   /* chapter nav labels, tags */
  --text-base: 17px;   /* reader body default (mobile) */
  --text-lg:   19px;   /* reader body large step */
  --text-xl:   22px;   /* chapter title */
  --text-2xl:  28px;   /* book title on detail page */
  --text-3xl:  36px;   /* site title / display */

  /* line height */
  --leading-tight:  1.4;
  --leading-reader: 1.75;  /* reader body default */
  --leading-loose:  2.0;   /* reader large line height */
  --leading-cjk:    1.9;   /* CJK default */
}
```

---

## Dark Mode Protocol

The reader page requires a dark mode toggle as a user-controlled preference, not OS-based switching. Discovery pages should support system dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme`.

The default implementation provides **light and dark** themes via DaisyUI. Add a third **sepia** theme only when the brief explicitly asks for it.

**Token strategy:** Use DaisyUI theme tokens (`base-100`, `base-content`, `accent`, etc.) for all color decisions. Swap the full theme under a `[data-theme]` attribute on `<html>` or the reader wrapper. Do not use Tailwind `dark:` classes for reader themes — they cannot handle three-way switching.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
plugins: [require('daisyui')],
daisyui: {
  themes: [
    { light: { 'base-100': '#f9f6f1', 'base-content': '#1a1814' } },
    { dark:  { 'base-100': '#141210', 'base-content': '#e8e4de' } },
  ],
}
```

**Contrast mandate:** WCAG AA minimum for body text (4.5:1) across all enabled themes. Test each theme before shipping. Do not ship a theme you have only seen in one mode.

**No pure extremes:** Off-black and off-white only. `#000000` and `#ffffff` kill depth and are banned in all themes.

---

## Motion Guidance

**Reader page:** No animations. No scroll effects. No entrance transitions. No infinite loops. Only permitted motion: theme-switch CSS transition (200ms), chapter-nav hover state (CSS only), settings panel slide-in (CSS only). Any JavaScript animation library is forbidden on the reader page.

**Discovery pages:** Motion is allowed when `MOTION_INTENSITY > 2` and the brief reads energetic (web novel, manga). Use Motion (`motion/react`) for scroll-reveal on cover grids and book cards. Use spring physics — no linear easing.

**Motion must be motivated.** Before adding any animation, ask: what does this communicate? Valid: hierarchy, storytelling, feedback, state change. Invalid: "it looked cool." Every animation needs a one-sentence justification.

**Reduced motion is mandatory.** Wrap all motion above intensity 2 in `prefers-reduced-motion` or `useReducedMotion()`. Infinite loops, scroll effects, and entrance transitions collapse to static under reduced motion.

**Forbidden patterns:**
- `window.addEventListener('scroll', ...)` — use Motion's `useScroll()` or IntersectionObserver.
- `useState` for continuous values (mouse position, scroll progress) — use `useMotionValue`.
- Typewriter animation on chapter titles. Particle effects on the reader surface. Parallax inside the prose column.

---

## AI-Tells Banned in Fiction UI

These are the patterns LLMs default to for reading-adjacent products. Avoid them unless the brief explicitly asks.

**Visual:**
- Gradient orbs, glowing blobs, frosted glass panels on the reader surface.
- Three equal feature cards in a row on the discovery page.
- Drop shadows heavier than `0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`.
- Corner-radius inconsistency (pill buttons in a sharp-card layout).

**Typography:**
- `Inter` as the default body font without a reason.
- `Fraunces` or `Instrument Serif` as display fonts — the two most-reached-for LLM serif defaults.
- Decorative `letter-spacing` on body text.
- Mixed font families in chapter prose.

**Content and copy:**
- Em-dash (`—`) anywhere — headlines, body, attribution, labels, buttons, captions. Use a regular hyphen (`-`) or restructure the sentence. Zero em-dashes is the rule, not a guideline.
- "Jane Doe" / "John Smith" as author names. Use contextually appropriate, believable names.
- Section-numbering eyebrows (`001 · Chapters`, `02 / Catalog`) — name sections plainly.
- Generic placeholder text in chapter content. Fiction sites must have real prose before shipping.
- Any reader-visible copy mentioning AI, Markdown, parser, prompt, skill, or generation.

**Layout:**
- Discovery page that is just a stretched phone screen on desktop.
- Navigation that wraps to two lines at desktop viewport.
- Empty bento cells — N items means N cells, no blank tiles.
- Scrollcue labels (`Scroll ↓`, `Scroll to explore`) — readers know what scroll is.

---

## Interface Copy Rules

Copy must feel editorial and reader-side. Words in an interface are design material — bring the same intentionality to copy that you bring to spacing and color.

Write from the reader's side of the screen. Name things by what readers control and recognize, never by how the system is built. Describe what something does in plain terms. Use active voice. A control says exactly what happens when used.

| Avoid | Use instead |
| --- | --- |
| "Submit" | "Continue reading" |
| "Content management" | "Chapter list" |
| "Operation successful" | "Added to shelf" |
| "No data" | "No books yet. Add a title to start reading." |
| "AI generated" | (never say this) |
| "Powered by AI" | (never say this) |
| "Markdown" | (never say this) |
| "Loading..." | "Loading chapter…" or a skeleton screen |

Empty states must tell the reader what to do next, not just that a data structure is empty. Error messages explain what went wrong and how to fix it — they do not apologize.

Keep one copy register per site. Do not mix editorial prose, technical labels, and marketing punch in the same composition.

**Copy self-audit before shipping:** Re-read every visible string. Flag anything grammatically broken, unclear in referent, or that sounds like an LLM trying to sound thoughtful ("elegant nothing" phrases, mock-poetic micro-meta, passive-aggressive humility). Rewrite every flagged string. Boring-but-clear beats cute-but-wrong.

---

## Self-Critique Before Build

Before writing any markup, check:

- Does the design read match the genre and audience, or is it a generic reading-app default?
- Would this palette and layout work equally well on a finance dashboard? If yes, it is too generic — revise.
- Is the signature element connected to reading, books, chapters, or genre? If not, revise.
- Does anything on the reader page compete with comfortable prose reading? If yes, remove it.
- Does the desktop layout have its own logic, or is it just wider? If just wider, revise.
- Is the type system derived from the audience and genre, or from a generic design kit? If the latter, revise.
- Is there an em-dash (`—`) anywhere in the planned copy? Replace it now.

---

## Self-Critique After Build

After taking screenshots:

- Remove one decorative element that was added.
- Increase body text size or line height before adjusting any decorative details.
- Confirm the reader page is calmer and more focused than the home page.
- Confirm the first visible screen shows a usable reading product, not brand theater.
- Confirm no reader-visible copy mentions AI, tools, or implementation details.
