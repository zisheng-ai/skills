# AdSense Site Builder

AdSense Site Builder is a single-entry skill built around two core goals: **getting the site through AdSense's first review quickly**, and **earning compounding organic search traffic**.

Both goals are driven by the same build standard: real interactive utility, original content depth, correct technical SEO, and complete trust pages (Privacy Policy must explicitly name Google AdSense and its cookies). Build for real users and both goals follow naturally.

Suited for builders who want to create niche site assets with real search demand and real user value — not thin AI article farms or sites that rely on risky traffic tactics.

## Site Types You Can Build

This skill helps build the following categories of AdSense-ready niche sites:

| Site type | Use case | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tool site | Calculators, generators, converters, validators | Salary calculator, JSON formatter, prompt generator |
| Template library | Copyable or downloadable reusable assets | Resume templates, email templates, Notion templates |
| Directory site | Curated lists with filter and comparison fields | AI tools directory, SaaS alternatives, resource lists |
| Comparison hub | Decision support and product/solution comparisons | X vs Y, best alternatives, best tool for a scenario |
| Checklist hub | Process-oriented topics with steps and timelines | Visa checklist, moving checklist, startup launch checklist |
| Tutorial hub | Step-by-step problem solving | Coding errors, Excel formulas, software workflows |
| Hybrid site | Niche covering multiple search intents | One core tool + guides, templates, and comparisons |

## How It Works

The skill runs the site build pipeline in phases:

1. **Validate the niche**: Mine candidates from Reddit, Google Autocomplete, AnswerThePublic, Product Hunt, and similar sources. Verify three demand signals (autocomplete confirmation + engagement on existing results + ≥10 supporting page angles). Filter through AdSense policy safety checks (banned categories, high-risk categories, advertiser demand tier, traffic quality risk).
2. **Plan keywords and SEO foundation**: Long-tail first (target KD ≤ 30 for new sites). Define title tag, meta description, and schema type for every page. Output site-map.json with an internal link map.
3. **Design the page model**: Read the brief → Design Read → token system → design anchor and three dials → anti-AI-default discipline → define non-thin page templates.
4. **Build the site**: Implement all pages and interactive features. Generate sitemap.xml, robots.txt, canonical tags, schema markup, internal link structure, and ad slot placeholders. Embed the AdSense auto-ads script in `<head>`. Meet Core Web Vitals targets (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1).
5. **Trust pages**: Create About, Contact, Privacy Policy (must name Google AdSense and its cookies), and Terms.
6. **Create the distribution plan (before go-live)**: Product Hunt, directory submissions, targeted community participation (contribute first, share second), YouTube Shorts demos, Pinterest (for template niches). 14-day day-by-day action plan. **Must be ready before launch** so day one executes immediately and the first 2–4 weeks of traffic are fully leveraged.
7. **Go live + GSC setup**: Deploy to production, execute day 1 of the distribution plan, register in GSC, submit sitemap, request indexing for the first batch of pages.
8. **AdSense readiness audit (2–4 weeks post-launch)**: Run after GSC has indexing and impression data. Check content quality, trust page completeness, technical requirements, policy compliance, and traffic quality. Output an audit report with a clear submission recommendation.
9. **GSC growth loop (monthly, post-approval)**: Find three opportunity types from GSC data — quick-win pages ranking 8–20, high-impression/low-CTR title problems, content gaps revealed by real queries. Improve each and document results.

## Notes

This skill does not guarantee AdSense approval. Its goal is to raise site quality, reduce low-value content risk, and avoid unsafe traffic tactics.

Always manually review generated content, legal pages, factual claims, and policy-sensitive topics before publishing.
